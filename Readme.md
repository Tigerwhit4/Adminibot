## About Adminibot
Adminibot is a free, open sourced, and actively supported Twitch tool. It allows you, the streamer, to manage your chat quickly, efficiently, and easily. The goal is to allow you to focus on streaming and having fun with your audience, instead of having to focus on moderating your chat. You can also allow (some of) your moderators to help you manage your chat.

Adminibot is a downloadable application you will be able to run from your own computer. Why wait for online competitors to join your chat, while you can just click a button and instantly have a moderating companion? There's no queues, lines, or waiting times, you just simply set up the bot and click a button.

## Adminibot Features
* **Dashboard** - A simple, categorized dashboard to allow you to manage Adminibot quickly.
* **Commands** - Should you want to manage Adminibot while not having access to the application itself, you can use commands to manage Adminibot directly through the Twitch chat. [Learn more...](Commands.md)
* **Stream Information** - Adminibot features a dedicated tab to all your stream's information so you can check how many viewers you have, what your title is, and whether your stream is still detected as 'Online'.
* **Spam Filters** - A selection of efficient, capable filters will help you keep spammers at bay.
* **Giveaway Tools** - A set of tools to allow you to give away items when you want to. You can use points to see how dedicated your viewers are, and you can use the points to allow your users to buy tickets to get into the giveaway.

## Commands
A huge part of Adminibot is the ability to manage everything directly from the Twitch chat. Whether you have access to the application or not, you'll still be able to manage Adminibot. There's a lot of commands available to help you, but don't let it all overwhelm you -- there a [cheat sheet](Commands.md) available, which has all the commands -- and their explanations -- listed in a few categories.

Commands are available to all users, not only you. However, you get to choose which user uses which. By default, moderators get more commands then regular users. However, they won't be able to access powerful options by default. To allow your moderators to access powerful options, you can opt to give them access to them (get a more in-depth explanation [here](Commands.md#explanation)).
